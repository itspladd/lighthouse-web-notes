# Orientation Presentation

## Five rules for success

1. Ask for help from both mentors and peers!
2. Put in the hours!!
    * Be prepared to work a lot on the weekend!
3. Take breaks and get proper sleep!
4. DON'T compare yourself to others!
    * Compare yourself to YOURSELF a day ago, two days ago, a week ago, etc
5. Get comfortable with being UNcomfortable!

## LHL Philosophies and Approach

* Core philosophy: Learn How To Learn
* Software development is a team sport
* This is a six-to-twelve-month journey - keep learning at this pace on the job!
* Hands-on learning is the only way to solidify knowledge!
* Flipped classroom - you get introduced to new concepts in activities before you get a lecture

## Typical day (EST):
* Workday: 9 AM to 9 PM
* Lecture: 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM
* New zoom link in our slack channel each day
* Mentor availability
  * 12:00 - 9:00 PM Mon-Thurs
  * 12:00 - 6:00 PM Friday
  * 12:00 - 4:00 PM Saturday
* Scheduling tapers in the last few weeks as we build projects

  * How are you feeling today?

## Weekly activities
* Weekly on Wednesdays (first Tuesday at 9 AM)
* Every other Friday at 3:30

## Culture
* Open and friendly!
* We have each other's backs!
* Zero tolerance for behavior that threatens an inclusive/safe environment
* Academic dishonesty is not accepted

## Connecting while Distancing
* Practice self-compassion
* Don't multi-task when talking with loved ones!
* Spend 15 minutes a day with someone important!

## Extra support
* LHL has plenty of support for mental health, etc. Reach out if you need it!

## 80/20
  * I will be doing 80% of the work. I get out of this what I put in! LHL is there to facilitate, guide, and support, but I have to put in the work.

## Next steps:

1. Get into my discord pod (posted in slack)! This runs from 12-5 EST each day.
2. Start Compass work: Week 1 day 1
